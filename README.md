# NLP Islamic Coach

## Description

NLP Islamic Coach is an AI framework designed to provide Islamic guidance and coaching using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages advanced AI models like Claude and GPT to offer insightful and accurate responses to users' queries. The framework includes specific instructions and protocols that enable AI models to provide accurate, respectful, and culturally appropriate Islamic guidance.

## Features

- Provides Islamic guidance based on user queries
- Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models
- Easy to integrate with various platforms
- Customizable to fit specific needs

## How It Works

The framework operates through a series of specialized instructions and protocols:

1. **Initialization**: The AI adopts the role of an Islamic coach with deep knowledge of Islamic teachings
2. **Context Awareness**: Maintains Islamic principles throughout conversations
3. **Adaptive Responses**: Provides guidance based on authentic Islamic sources
