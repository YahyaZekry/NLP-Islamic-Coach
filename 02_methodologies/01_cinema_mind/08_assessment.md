# CINEMA MIND ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CINEMA_MIND_ASSESSMENT -->
## Mental Movie Inventory Protocol
<!-- AI.CONTEXT: MOVIE_INVENTORY_PROTOCOL -->

### Purpose
This protocol guides the assessment of the key mental Movies playing in a client's mind. This serves as the foundation for Cinema Mind interventions.

### Implementation Guidelines
- Integrate questions naturally into conversation
- Calibrate to verbal and textual cues that indicate internal Movies
- Adjust depth and pacing based on client responsiveness
- Begin with general exploration before detailed assessment
- Document key Movies for future reference and intervention

### Conversation Flow: Initial Movie Awareness
```
1. Current Movie Detection:
   - Ask: "As we begin our conversation, I'm curious what's going through your mind right now. What images or scenes might be playing in your mind?"

   - Follow-up: "Are you seeing this through your own eyes, or are you watching yourself in the scene?"

2. Movie Impact Assessment:
   - Ask: "How does this mental scene affect how you're feeling right now?"
   - Follow-up: "What physical sensations come with this Movie?"
   - Follow-up: "How does this Movie influence what you feel like doing?"

3. Calibration Points:
   - Note language patterns indicating visual processing (see, picture, image, etc.)
   - Note references to internal dialogue or sounds
   - Note descriptions of emotional states and physical sensations
   - Identify perspective markers (seeing through own eyes vs. watching self)

### Assessment Decision Tree
```
Based on Movie Inventory Assessment:

IF client shows high Movie awareness AND strong resource Movies AND high motivation:
   THEN proceed to direct Cinema Mind interventions
   RECOMMEND targeting highest-impact Movies first

IF client shows moderate Movie awareness BUT weak resource Movies:
   THEN begin with resource Movie development
   RECOMMEND starting with success/achievement Movies

IF client shows limited Movie awareness:
   THEN start with awareness development
   RECOMMEND simple Movie detection exercises

IF client shows strong heart disease Movies:
   THEN prioritize heart disease transformation
   RECOMMEND Islamic perspective integration

IF client shows strong negative Movies BUT low change motivation:
   THEN focus on benefits exploration
   RECOMMEND connecting transformation to values
```

### Feature Analysis Decision Tree
```
Based on Feature Analysis:

IF Movie has close/large/bright negative imagery:
   THEN suggest distance/size/brightness adjustments
   RECOMMEND starting with distance before other adjustments

IF Movie has harsh/loud internal voice:
   THEN suggest volume/tone/location adjustments
   RECOMMEND relocating voice to external source first

IF Movie has intense bodily sensations:
   THEN suggest intensity/location adjustments

   THEN suggest perspective shift to dissociated view
   RECOMMEND third position observation first

IF Movie lacks spiritual dimension AND this aligns with client values:
   THEN suggest adding Islamic perspective
   RECOMMEND divine awareness integration
```

   THEN begin with third position development
   RECOMMEND simple observation exercises first

IF client shows strong third position access BUT limited first position:
   THEN focus on first position reconnection
