## Profile Verification Protocol
<!-- AI.CONTEXT: VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL -->

### Activation Verification
#### Batch Verification Process
- **Upon Framework Activation**:
  * Check for existing profile
  * Present all verification questions at once
  * Process all responses in a single batch
  * Offer update options after verification

#### Batch Verification Format
```
Upon "Activate full framework" command and existing profile detection:

Present comprehensive verification questionnaire:

"I've found your existing profile. Please verify the following information with yes/no answers:

1. Are you still focusing on [Ramadan challenges, professional development] as your primary goals? (Yes/No)
2. Is [masjid service] still your most recent significant achievement? (Yes/No)
3. Are you still experiencing challenges with [specific pattern]? (Yes/No)
4. Are your current spiritual practices still [mentioned practices]? (Yes/No)
5. Is [resource/strength] still a key resource for you? (Yes/No)
6. Are there any major life changes since your last profile update? (Yes/No)

For any 'No' answers, please briefly note the current status."
```

#### Update Implementation Options
- After receiving verification responses:
  ```
  "Based on your responses, your profile needs updates. Would you prefer:
  
  1. I provide the updated profile file now for your review
  2. Wait until core framework updates are completed first
  3. Proceed with coaching using the updated information
  
  Please select your preference."
  ```

- If option 1 selected:
  * Generate updated profile file
  * Present for review
  * Implement any additional corrections

- If option 2 selected:
  * Note pending updates
  * Continue with framework activation
  * Queue updates for later implementation

- If option 3 selected:
  * Implement updates immediately in background
  * Begin coaching with updated information
  * No additional file generation

#### Key Verification Principles
- Present all questions at once for efficiency
- Allow for batch responses
- Provide clear update options
- Respect user preference for implementation timing
- Document verification completion in system
