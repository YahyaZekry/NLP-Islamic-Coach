# PROFILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: PROFILE_MANAGEMENT -->
<!-- AI.CONTEXT: VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL -->
## Profile Verification Protocol

### Activation Verification
#### Profile Existence Check
- **Upon Framework Activation**:
  * Check for existing profile
  * If no profile exists:
    - Initiate profile creation protocol
    - Present profile creation questionnaire
    - Skip verification process entirely
  * If profile exists:
    - Proceed with batch verification process
    - Extract actual profile data for verification questions
    - Present dynamic verification questions using real profile data
    - Process responses and offer updates

#### Batch Verification Process
- **Only When Profile Exists**:
  * Extract actual profile content for verification
  * Dynamically generate verification questions using the real data
  * Present all verification questions at once
  * Process all responses in a single batch
  * Offer update options after verification

#### Dynamic Verification Format
```
Upon "Activate full framework" command and existing profile detection:

// Extract actual goals, achievements, challenges, practices, and resources from profile
// Generate questions using the exact data from profile, not hardcoded examples

Present comprehensive verification questionnaire:

"I've found your existing profile. Please verify the following information with yes/no answers:

1. Are you still focusing on [ACTUAL_GOALS_FROM_PROFILE] as your primary goals? (Yes/No)
2. Is [ACTUAL_ACHIEVEMENT_FROM_PROFILE] still your most recent significant achievement? (Yes/No)
3. Are you still experiencing challenges with [ACTUAL_PATTERNS_FROM_PROFILE]? (Yes/No)
4. Are your current spiritual practices still [ACTUAL_PRACTICES_FROM_PROFILE]? (Yes/No)
5. Is [ACTUAL_RESOURCE_FROM_PROFILE] still a key resource for you? (Yes/No)
6. Are there any major life changes since your last profile update? (Yes/No)

For any 'No' answers, please briefly note the current status."
```

#### Profile Creation Protocol
```
Upon "Activate full framework" command and NO existing profile detection:

"I don't have an existing profile for you. Let's create one to optimize the framework for your needs. Please answer the following questions:

1. What are your primary goals currently? (e.g., spiritual growth, professional development)
2. What has been a significant recent achievement you're proud of?
3. Are there specific challenges or patterns you're working on?
4. What spiritual practices are currently part of your routine?
5. What would you identify as key resources or strengths you possess?
6. Any major life circumstances I should be aware of to better support you?

This information will help me tailor the framework to your specific needs."
```

#### Update Implementation Options
- After receiving verification or creation responses:
  ```
  "Based on your responses, your profile [needs updates/has been created]. Would you prefer:
  
  1. I provide the updated/new profile file now for your review
  2. Wait until core framework updates are completed first
  3. Proceed with coaching using the updated/new information
  
  Please select your preference."
  ```

- If option 1 selected:
  * Generate updated/new profile file
  * Present for review
  * Implement any additional corrections

- If option 2 selected:
  * Note pending updates/creation
  * Continue with framework activation
  * Queue updates for later implementation

- If option 3 selected:
  * Implement updates/creation immediately in background
  * Begin coaching with updated/created information
  * No additional file generation

#### Dynamic Data Extraction
- Profile data extraction must use actual profile content:
  * Read goals from "Primary Goals" section
  * Extract achievements from "Key Milestones" section
  * Identify challenges from "Challenge Areas" section
  * Retrieve practices from "Current Practice" section
  * Extract resources from "Strength Resources" section
  * Never use hardcoded placeholder examples

#### Key Verification Principles
- Check for profile existence first
- Only verify existing profiles with their actual data
- Create new profiles when none exist
- Present all questions at once for efficiency
- Allow for batch responses
- Provide clear update options
- Respect user preference for implementation timing
- Document verification completion in system

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: UPDATE_IMPLEMENTATION -->
## Update Implementation

### Profile File Generation
- **Complete Profile Export**:
  * Generate full profile in proper format
  * Include all updated information
  * Maintain structure integrity
  * Preserve historical data when appropriate

- **Update-Only Export**:
  * Generate file with only changed elements
  * Highlight modifications for review
  * Include implementation recommendations
  * Provide change justification

### Implementation Methods
- **Immediate Implementation**:
  * Apply updates to active profile
  * Update all related framework elements
  * Ensure cross-component consistency
  * Verify implementation completion

- **Queued Implementation**:
  * Store updates in pending queue
  * Maintain current profile for active session
  * Implement during framework maintenance
  * Notify on completion

### Verification Documentation
- Record verification timestamp
- Document specific changes
- Note implementation method
- Track update history

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: COLLECTION_METHODS -->
## Information Collection Methods

### Direct Questions
Appropriate contexts for direct information gathering:
- Initial profile creation
- Formal assessments
- Specific section updates
- Client-initiated sharing

### Natural Extraction
Gathering information through regular conversation:
- Identify relevant details mentioned spontaneously
- Extract patterns from recurring themes
- Note changes in approach or perspective
- Document successes and challenges

### Observation-Based
Information gathered through observation:
- Response patterns to interventions
- Learning style indicators
- Implementation effectiveness
- Recurring challenges
- Heart state manifestations

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: MAINTENANCE -->
## Profile Maintenance

### Regular Review
- Check profile accuracy weekly
- Add new observations as they occur
- Refine pattern descriptions
- Update progress indicators

### Adaptive Development
- Expand sections based on coaching focus
- Deepen information in active areas
- Track pattern evolution over time
- Adjust based on implementation results

### Integration Quality
- Ensure coherence across sections
- Connect related patterns
- Validate pattern recognition
- Confirm accurate representation

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: ERROR_HANDLING -->
## Error Handling Protocols

### Profile Not Found Handling
- Clear and specific message when no profile exists
- Immediate triggering of profile creation
- Skip verification entirely
- Prevent reference to non-existent data

### Invalid Data Handling
- Detection of corrupted profile data
- Option to repair or rebuild profile
- Preservation of valid sections
- Clear communication about data issues

### User Correction Protocol
- Allow immediate correction of profile errors
- Provide verification of corrections
- Update system with corrected information
- Document correction history

### Data Extraction Safety
- Verify data exists before attempting extraction
- Handle missing sections gracefully
- Fall back to generic questions if specific data unavailable
- Never reference placeholder data as if it were user data
