    - "[YourCoach]: When you think about [specific issue/topic/goal], what comes to mind? What Movies play out on the theater of your mind?"
    - "[YourCoach]: If I were to peek into the theater of your mind right now concerning [issue], what would I see, hear, and feel?"
    - "[YourCoach]: As you consider [situation], are you aware of any images, sounds, or sensations that form a kind of mental Movie?"

2.  **State-to-Movie Elicitation**:

    - "[YourCoach]: You mentioned feeling [specific emotion, e.g., anxious, motivated, stuck]. When you experience that feeling, what mental Movie tends to be playing?"
    - "[YourCoach]: Our states often reflect the Movies we're watching internally. What kind of Movie (e.g., horror, comedy, drama, adventure) would correspond to how you're feeling right now about [issue]?"

    - "[YourCoach]: Some people are more aware of one sensory channel than others. Which seems most prominent for you in this Movie: the visuals, the sounds, or the feelings?"

    - "[YourCoach]: How clear or fuzzy is this mental Movie?"
    - "[YourCoach]: Is it more like a vague idea, a series of snapshots, or a full-motion picture?"
    - "[YourCoach]: On a scale of 1-10, how vivid and engaging is this internal Movie?"

3.  **Conscious Awareness Level**:
    - "[YourCoach]: Before we started talking about it, were you consciously aware of this specific mental Movie playing when you thought about [issue]?"
